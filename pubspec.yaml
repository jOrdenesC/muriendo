# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43

# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
      - Assets/images/
      - Assets/figures/
      - Assets/audio/
      - Assets/videos/
      - Assets/
      - Assets/images/buttons/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolutioÂºn-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Gotham
      fonts:
        - asset: Assets/fonts/gothamrounded-bold.otf
        - asset: Assets/fonts/gothamroundedbold_21016.ttf
        - asset: Assets/fonts/gothamrounded-book.otf
        - asset: Assets/fonts/gothamroundedbook_21018.ttf

    - family: Nunito
      fonts:
        # - asset: Assets/fonts/Nunito-ExtraBold.ttf
        # - asset: Assets/fonts/Nunito-Regular.ttf
        # - asset: Assets/fonts/Nunito-Bold.ttf
        # - asset: Assets/fonts/Nunito-SemiBold.ttf
        - asset: Assets/fonts/Nunito-Black.ttf
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
